1. Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are currently reading the README file for the MEF Project.This project will
be hosted very soon under http://sourceforge.net/.

The MEF is an open-source tool for the assignment of chemical structure information to
mass spectrometry data, implemented in the programming language Java(tm). The
library is published under terms of the standard The GNU General Public License 
(GPL) v3. This has implications on what you can do with sources and binaries of the
MEF library. For details, please refer to the file LICENSE, which should have
been provided with this distribution.

PLEASE NOTE: This is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

2. Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before to be able to run successfully the MEF tool you need a working installation
of the following other tools:

 - java 1.5 or higher

 - R/Bioconductor Project for Statiscal Computing. http://www.r-project.org/
 
 - Rserve R library. More information you can find here: 
 http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/doc.html
  
 - XCMS library. More information you can find here: http://metlin.scripps.edu/xcms/. 
 You may install bioconductor's XCMS library just issuing the following within your
 R console:
 
		source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
		biocLite("xcms")

 - Graphviz library
 		
 		biocLite("Rgraphviz")
 		sudo apt-get install libgraphviz-dev
 		

3. Using MEF tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to use the MEF tool in your program, you need to run the jar file. An
example using the command line could be that: 
MEF/$ R CMD Rserve
MEF/$ java -jar sams-0.1.3.git.jar -sn=1 -mzgap=0.5 -rint=0 -acc=5 -e=[C1..15,H1..9,O0..4,N0..2] -rules=[RDBER,nitrogenR] -imzXML  F002169_C15H9O4.mzXML -ocml  F002169_C15H9O4.cml process

After the process is finished it will create a cml file enriched with chemical
information together with the spectra.

4. Source Code
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can download the source code of our MEF tool as a tarball through our webpage.

5. Help
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following command will show information about how to use the MEF tool:
MEF/$ java -jar sams-0.1.3.git.jar -H

The information shown is displayed below:

MEF processes and enriches spectral tree data

Usage: java -jar sams-0.1.3.git.jar [Parameters] <input spec> <output spec> [action]

Each spec can be a file whose extension decides the format. Optionally,
the format can be specified by preceding the file by -i<format-type> 
e.g. -imzXML, for input and -o<format-type> for output.

See below for available format-types, which are the same as the 
file extensions and are case independent.
If no output file is defined stdout is used instead.

Parameters
-acc=    Maximal accuracy range. Set in ppm. E.g. -acc=5
-e=      Elements to be included, together with the
         the upper-/lower-limit of the number of atoms
         e.g. -e=[C1..15,H1..9,O0..4,N0..2]
-mzgap=  Minimal distance between adjacent peaks. E.g. -mzgap=0.5
-rules=  Constrain rules applied to the formula
         e.g. -rules=[RDBER,nitrogenR]
-rint=   Relative intensity threshold. E.g. -rint=0
-sn=     Signal to noise threshold. E.g. -sn=1
-F       List of recognized file formats use
-R       List of recognized constraint formula rules
-H       Outputs this help text
If no parameters are defined default settings are used.

Actions
convert -- Convert into other format mass spectral tree data
process -- Processes and enriches mass spectral tree data
